## Introduction
With the **vhtp** toolbox, anyone can easily work with EEG data using MATLAB-Octave programming language. The **vhtp** philosophy: You can produce ready-to-use EEG outputs with a **simple set of functions** that implement your favorite EEG toolkits.

## Key Features
Is there room for another opensource EEG toolkit? The **vhtp** toolkit focuses on clean *implementation* and *reporting* of EEG analysis. **vhtp** implements wrappers around functions from all major EEG toolkits including EEGLAB, Fieldtrip, and Brainstorm.
  - **Centered around SET:** Every core function in **vhtp** uses an **EEGLAB SET** structure as an input, output, or both. Example: *utility_htpImportEeg* converts a directory of original EEG files into SET files.
  - **Extensible:** The EEGLAB SET structure is a common format across a variety of EEG systems and direct access to data. Therefore, any custom or external toolbox code can easily be incorporated into template functions. Example: *eeg_htpCalcChirpItcErsp* uses EEGLAB function newtimef to calculate intratrial coherence and event-related spectral pertubation. 
  - **Comprehensive pipeline**: **vhtp** includes functions for import, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
  - **High Throughput:** Our research team has collected over 4,000 dense-array EEGs. We have implemented parallel processing, batch preprocessing processing, and binary/CUDA independent component analysis to handle large batch jobs.
  - **Highly visual:** Viewing data and intermediate results is essential to high quality EEG analysis. Visual tools are implemented at every step of a **vhtp** pipeline. Example: utility_htpImportEeg outputs a topographic PNG file of channel locations for manual verifiction. eeg_htpPreprocessStage4 uses a custom GUI and toolboxes to provide dipole, topographic, timeseries views for artifact rejection.
  - **Export to R:** The default output of **vhtp** functions are CSV files and cut-and-paste R data dictionary for import. 
  - **Focus on quality control and audit:** From each function, CSV tables are produced, tracking timestamps and processing details. Tools are included to extract key information (i.e., removed components) from a directory of SET files for reporting.
  - **Clinical Focus:** We have implemented this pipeline for the analysis of clinical trial data which requires approaches such as blinded preprocessing and compliance to specific FDA Part 11 code.
  - **Export to BIDS:** Following import to SET, data directories confirming to EEG BIDS specifications can be created for sharing.
